# ospo-request-public

This repository helps get Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) signed and Developer Certificate of Origin (DCOs) approved, so that developers can contribute to third-party open source projects. Just submit an issue to [newrelic/ospo-request](https://github.com/newrelic/ospo-request).

([newrelic/ospo-request](https://github.com/newrelic/ospo-request) needs to be company-private, so staff who are not signed in via SSO will get a 404. To prevent that we have this public repo containing nothing but this README. When linking to ospo-request, please share this always-public link instead).
